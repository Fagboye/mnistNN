I am Caleb. This respository contains my first neural network on my journey as an AI Engineer. 
I built a neural network using the mnist dataset of numbers. It was a simple neural network. 

I also used the pygame library to create an interafce where a number can be written with the mouse and sent to the model to make a prediction i.e. classify the number 

It was a beatufiul project, I learnt about the relu and softmax activation functions. 

I hope to build more and more models in my life. It is a goal that next is more interesting than the previous. 
I would also like to build relationships in the field of Artificial Intelligence
